DeviceDiscovery

    Implements an active multicast listener for Windows 10 Core IoT device advertisements, services to manage a 
    collection of active devices on the local network, and an eventing architecture to make it easy for subscribers
    to know when devices are discovered, when they become unavailable, as well as when properties on the device
    have changed (e.g. name, IP address).  
    
    This project provides programmatic access to many of the capabilities that are found in the Windows IoT Watcher 
    application and is built as a Win32 Console application to demonstrate usage.
