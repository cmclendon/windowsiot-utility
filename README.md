DeviceDiscovery
    DiscoveryService and Device class that provides an active multicast listener for Windows 10 Core IoT device
    advertisements, services to manage a collection of active devices on the local network, and an eventing 
    architecture to make it easy for subscribers to know when devices go online and offline.  This project 
    provides programmatic access to many of the capabilities that are found in the Windows IoT Watcher 
    application and is built as a Win32 Console application to demonstrate DiscoveryService usage.
